# Web3Forms HTML Registration Form

This project is a simple and functional HTML form that collects user data and submits it using the [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com) API — a lightweight and powerful form backend service that requires no server-side code.

## Overview

The form includes the following input fields:

- 👤 Name  
- 📧 Email address  
- 📞 Phone number  
- 🚻 Gender (Radio buttons)  
- 🎓 Year of pass-out (Dropdown)  
- 💻 Programming languages known (Checkboxes)  
- 📁 Resume upload (File input)

Form data is submitted via a `POST` request to Web3Forms using your unique access key.
